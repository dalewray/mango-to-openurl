# mango-to-openurl


This script is designed to convert permalinks from a library catalog using the Mango Platform to permalinks formatted in the OpenURL standard.  It is specifically written to convert permalinks used in SpringShareâ€™s LibGuides link assets.
Options are available in config.json or may be passed via the command line.

`yarn prod` will run with options in config.json

`yarn test` will run only the first 10 records

`yarn log` will run yarn prod and save standard output to log.txt

pass arguments example:
`yarn prod testTrueOrFalse rateLimitInMicroseconds OldStemURL NewStemURL Primo_view_code InputFile.csv OutputFile.csv`

If an asset does not have a url matching oldStemUrl the record ID will be output and skipped with a message

If an assert does not have a url, an attempt to create on based on the record title will be generated and added to a new column 'SuggestedUrl'

If an asset has a url, the existing url will be replaced and a message with the new url will be output.
